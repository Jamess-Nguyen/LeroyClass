		<h3 id="1">What is the game?</h3>
		<p>Leroy the Chef Spider: Spice Chronicles is a charming and cartoonish single player 2-D platformer where players will get to jump (and stick) around as our beloved spider, Leroy, and explore his tiny and terrifying world through various complex levels. Each level features different surfaces, obstacles, and enemies that Leroy will need to stealthily navigate through in an attempt to collect all the Spices on the level and reach the exit as fast as possible.</p>
		
		<h3 id="2">Why create this game? </h3>
		<p>    We are big fans of 2-D platformers and stealth games, so we decided to make a game that paid homage to both! Our team was also fascinated with the idea of creating a game that is easy to learn, but hard to master. A game where mechanical skill mattered, and one where taking the time to understand the intricacies of the game would be critical in achieving higher scores.</p>
		
		<h3 id="3">Where does the game take place?</h3>
		<p>Leroy lives in the kitchen of an abandoned human home filled with other critters. Most of his adventures take place in infested cupboards, where he is searching for Spices so that he can create new recipes. Mundane objects that you would find in a kitchen, such as a fork, are gigantic from the perspective of a little spider, and serve as the main props within the game levels. </p>
		
		<h3 id="4">What do I control?</h3>
		<p>Players will only be able to control Leroy, and move him around the level by jumping and sticking to surfaces. Leroy cannot “walk” around the level like other traditional platformers. He can however control the angle and power of his jump ability.</p>
		
		<h3 id="5">What is the main focus? And what's different about this game?</h3>
		<p>Players are tasked with collecting all the available Spices on the level and reaching the exit, all while simultaneously dodging enemies and navigating through tough environmental obstacles. Completion of the levels is determined by the total amount of Spices collected and the overall time taken. Players will then be awarded a Star Rating based on their performance.</p>

		<p>There are many games that are 2-D platformers that have stealth aspects; however, what truly separates us apart from the competition is our mechanical gameplay. The fact that our character can only move throughout the level by jumping and sticking to surfaces, makes it difficult to navigate the most “simple” terrain. What makes it even more challenging is the timed aspect, so players are pressured to find the most optimal path and make the least amount of jumps in order to collect all the Spices in a timely manner.</p>
