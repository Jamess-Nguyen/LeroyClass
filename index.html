      <td><h3>Leroy the Chef Spider is an interesting platform game.</h3> <p>Players have to figure out how to jump from surfaces in order to move. Plotting how far they are going to jump an dwhere they are going to land is much more interesting than simply salking everywhere. </p>
		  <h5>Easy to Learn, But Hard to Master</h5>
		  <p>We want to create a game that is simple enough for anyone to understand, while not limiting the skill ceiling. It was important that players would feel rewarded for masterful gameplay, and that there was a point to taking the time to learn the nuances of the game. Challenging mechanics is really at the core of our game development principles. </p>
		  <h5>Fluid Movement</h5>
    	  <p>We want to make traversing Leroy’s world fun and engaging. We believe that this is achieved through fluid movement design in controls and animation. If players are having fun just hopping around mindlessly, then we can call the game a success. </p>
		  <h5>Immersion</h5>
		  <p>We want to maintain the player’s immersion in our game world by ensuring that we are consistently following a set of rules that make the gameplay smooth and seamless. For example, if a surface looks like Leroy should be able to stick to it, Leroy will be able to stick to it. Additionally, we want the props and enemies to be relatively proportional to Leroy’s perspective, so that players feel that they are actually the size of a spider!</p>
